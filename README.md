# customer-prediction

This project analyzes' potential customers' likelihood of conversion for a sample EdTech Startup: ExtraaLearn. The EdTech Industry has had massive growth, especially in online education. Given this surge, it's important to have efficient ways to access and prioritize leads, such that their marketing efforts are well-targeted. In order to accomplish this, this project leverages various machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a lead converting into a customer based on a variety of attributes, such as:

1. Demographics - age, region, education level, etc
2. Behavioral Features - website interactions, time spent on platform, etc
3. Lead source - referral, social media, etc
4. Previous Interactions - past inquiries, downloads, etc
5. Conversion status - whether the lead converted to a customer

My methodology for this project was as follows:
1. Data Preprocessing - handling missing values, data cleaning, feature selection, etc
2. Exploratory Data Analysis - univariate/bivariate analysis, visualizing key insights
3. Model Training - RandomForest, DecisionTree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting
4. Model Evaluation - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
5. Interpretability and Business Insights

Key findings and performance metrics can be found in the notebook attached in this repo.
